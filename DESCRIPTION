Description: A new metric named 'dependency heaviness' is proposed that measures the number 
    of additional dependency packages that a parent package brings to its child package 
    and are unique to the dependency packages imported by all other parents.  
    The dependency heaviness analysis is visualized by a customized heatmap. 
    The package is described in Gu et al. 2022 <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btac449>.
