Description: It checks the heaviness of the packages that user's
    package depends on. For each package listed in the "Depends", "Imports" and
    "Suggests" fields in the DESCRIPTION file, it opens a new R session, loads the
    package and counts the number of namespaces that are loaded. The summary of
    the dependencies is visualized by a customized heatmap.
