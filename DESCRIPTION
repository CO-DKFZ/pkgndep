Description: It checks the heaviness of a package's dependency, i.e. number of 
    other packages that are loaded directly or indirectly when loading the package. 
    For each package listed in the "Depends", "Imports" and
    "Suggests" fields in the DESCRIPTION file, it opens a new R session, loads the
    package and counts the number of namespaces that are loaded. The summary of
    the dependency is visualized by a customized heatmap.
